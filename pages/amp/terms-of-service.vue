        <h3>14. Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringements</h3>
        Blavity respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our users to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Services.

        Blavity’s intellectual property policy is to (a) remove material that Blavity believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Services, and (b) remove any Subscriber Content posted to the Services by “repeat infringers.” Blavity considers a “repeat infringer” to be any user that has uploaded Subscriber Content to the Services and for whom Blavity has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) with respect to such Subscriber Content. Blavity has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any user after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon Blavity’s own determination.

        <u>Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement</u>

        If you believe that any content made available on or through the Services has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below. Your communication must include substantially the following:

        <span> A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed</span>

        <span>Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works</span>

        <span>Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Blavity to locate the material</span>

        <span>Information reasonably sufficient to permit Blavity to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted</span>

        <span>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law and </span>

        <span> A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</span>

        <span>You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.</span>

        <u>Designated Agent Contact Information</u>
